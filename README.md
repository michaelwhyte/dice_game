Rules of the Game
-----------------
These rules are modified rules from the [Codeacademy Dice game](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/conditionals-application/0/1) mentioned above.

Each game consists of three rolls of two dice each for the player and for the computer player.

The player with the highest total points after three rounds dice rolls wins the game. If both players have the same points then the game is a tie.

Points are awarded in the following way:

If either dice rolled is a 1 then the player is awarded 0 points

If both dice rolled have the same point value then player is awarded double the face value of the dice rolled.

If both dice neither have a face value of 1 or do not have the same face value then the total of the two dices face values are awarded to the player.
